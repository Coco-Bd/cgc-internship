# CGC Internship Report — Static Site

This is a **fully static** one-page site matching the school rubric (form, clarity, content).
It includes: dark mode, smooth scrolling, clean print CSS (export to PDF), and an accessible, neutral design.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (user site)

1. Create a public repo named exactly: `<your-username>.github.io`
2. Upload the files in this folder to the repo root.
3. Add a `.nojekyll` file at the repo root (already included here).
4. In GitHub → **Settings → Pages**, set Source = `Deploy from a branch`, Branch = `main`, Folder = `/ (root)`.
5. Visit `https://<your-username>.github.io/`

## Edit content
Update `index.html` sections (Introduction, Company, Missions & Role, Tools & Methods, Responsibilities,
Team & Communication, Curiosity & Autonomy, Personal Assessment, Conclusion, Timeline).
